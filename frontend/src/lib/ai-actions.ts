In a real implementation, this would contain the actual content of your document, which could then be used for summarization, flashcard generation, or other AI-powered features.

The document would be processed using appropriate libraries or APIs based on its file type (PDF, DOCX, or TXT).

You could then use this extracted text with the other AI functions in this application, such as:
- Generating a summary
- Creating flashcards
- Building a research plan
- And more!`
